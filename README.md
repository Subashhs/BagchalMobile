Core
 
1. Core Gameplay:  
Two-player strategy game with asymmetric roles. One player control 4 tigers, while the other controls 20 goats. The game is split into two phases: Goat Placement & Tiger Movement (Phase 1), followed by Goat & Tiger Movement (Phase 2).
   
2. Core Mechanics:
Tigers move and can capture goats by jumping over them. Goats place themselves strategically to block tiger movement and can move only after all 20 are placed.
Win Condition:
Tigers win by capturing 5 goats. Goats win by blocking all tiger movements, preventing them from making any valid moves.
 
3. Turn Structure:
Goats always start by placing a goat in any empty intersection as tigers will be at the four corners of the board. Tigers can move in one space or capture goats during both phases of the game.
 
4. Movement:
Tigers move along connected lines to adjacent intersections. Can jump over goats to capture them if the space behind the goat is empty. Goats can only move once all are placed. Move one space to adjacent intersections, cannot jump.

Expanded Core Loop
Gameplay Breakdown: 
Phase 1: Goat Placement and Tiger Movement:
Goats are placed one at a time by the goat player, while the tiger player can move their tigers or capture goats if possible. This phase focuses on the goat player positioning their pieces to block tigers while tigers aim to capture vulnerable goats.

Phase 2: Goat and Tiger Movement:
Once all goats are placed, both players move alternately. Goats aim to restrict tiger movements while tigers attempt to create openings for capturing goats.

 Board:
A 5×5 grid with lines connecting intersections where pieces can move. 
 
Pieces:
4 Tiger pieces: Colored or shaped distinctly to stand out.
